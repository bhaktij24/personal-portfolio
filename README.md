# personal-portfolio
This is a website created on localhost for adding one's portfolio. For now, there's only one portfolio existing and that is mine
#

The portfolio has html pages, bootstrap formatting, apps for blogging and portfolio.

One can navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin to view/add/delete/modify the added blogs and portfolios
One can navigate to http://localhost:8000/blogs will let you display the already added blogs
There is admin login - a superuser, created through django-admin command
This is a multi-app project, but is a very simple one. Just run the server and you are good to go!
